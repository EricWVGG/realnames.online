They vary widely from culture to culture in meaning, history, length, and order, and continue to be highly susceptible to change, differentiation, and permutation, accommodating for nicknames, marital names, and changed spelling.</p>

                            <p>Fake names, or pseudonyms, have been around for centuries—before the internet was ever a hope or a dream.</p>
                            <p>Some have chosen to use pseudonyms to separate themselves due to fame or recognition. Others look to protect themselves (and their families) by separating their name from potentially volatile, counter-cultural or transgressive ideas (e.g. writers, artists, politicians, witnesses, and activists).</p>
                            <p>Different settings can call for different uses of names; nicknames within circles of friends and family, abridged names in casual settings, or an absence of names within support groups<!-- like Alcoholics Anonymous-->.</p>
